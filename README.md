# cv_website-backend

## Introduction

This repository contains cv_website-backend, a personal project that demonstrates my expertise in back-end development and AI integration. The project focuses on providing a robust API for text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and interactions with large language models (LLM).
This repository was used as the backbone for a talking avatar using my other frontend repo 

## Project Highlights

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Implementation showcasing conversion of text to realistic speech.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Demonstrating the accurate transcription of spoken words into text.
- **LLM Interactions**: Examples of utilizing large language models for text generation and processing.

## Technologies Used

The project mainly leverages FastAPI python. it consists of a Gunicorn server that brodcasts an API capable of performing different tasks based on the use case 

## Project Structure

- A brief description of how the project is organized, highlighting any unique architectural choices or patterns you employed.

## Key Implementations

- **TTS Feature**: For this project, Azure TTS was used 
- **STT Feature**: For this project, Azure's STT service was also used
- **LLM Integration**: Openai's GPT-3.5 was used for text generation

## Challenges and Learning

- One of the main challengs was reducing the response time(throughput) from the beginning to the end of the pipeline while keeping the user engaged 

## Future Enhancements

- Incoperate whisper-dstill instead of the small-whisper 
- Incoperate llama technologies rather than GPT3.5
- Incoperate better open-source TTS and SST

## About the Developer

- A brief introduction about yourself, your interests, and your areas of expertise.
